# Frogger
### Sachi Barnaby


## Getting started

Start with the FroggerGame class. Run here and a game menu will pop up. Press the button to begin playing the game.
You are operating as the frog which starts at the bottom of the screen. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to 
move the frog left, right, up and down. Your goal is to reach the lilypads at the bottom of the screen. You must avoid 
the vehicles in the bottom half of the game, and use the logs and turtles to cross the river on the top half. The green
space at the bottom and in the middle is a safe zone. However, the green at the top is not safe except for the lilypads.

To win the game, fill up the lilypads with 5 frogs. You have 3 lives over the course of the whole game. 
Whether you win or lose, you can restart the game by pressing the button that appears when the game ends.

## Bugs
There is sometimes a bug where the game slows down significantly. I recommend restarting the game if you are having 
trouble with response. The program should respond fairly quickly. 

Additionally, there was sometimes a bug with the frogs not remaining on the lilypad after a consecutive win.
